# Scratch Card API — User Documentation

## Overview

When your order total exceeds **₹200**, you automatically receive a scratch card. You can scratch it **immediately after placing the order** to reveal a **coupon code** that you can redeem on your next order.

## API

**POST** `/orders/:orderId/scratch-coupon`

**Auth:** Required (Bearer Token)

**Params**

| Param     | Type   | Description          |
|-----------|--------|----------------------|
| `orderId` | String | The ID of your order |

**Example Request**
```
POST /orders/ORD-123456/scratch-coupon
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

**Success Response** `200`
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Congratulations! Here is your coupon code.",
  "couponCode": "SAVE50NOW"
}
```

**If already scratched** `400`
```json

}
```

**Error Responses**

## How It Works

1. Place an order with a total amount **above ₹200**
2. A scratch card with a coupon code is automatically assigned to your order
3. Scratch the card **immediately** from the order confirmation screen
4. The coupon code is revealed — use it on your next order at checkout
